Assignment 1 - Roman Numerals Kata
Description
A "Kata" is a known and replicable form of action and is a concept directly derived from martial arts.  As appropriated in a software context, you can think of these as reinforcing exercises to shape and hone principles and approaches to the practice of software architectural and engineering design.  A strong underlying theme is that regular engagement in a "Kata" fosters mastery.
A test-driven, test first paradigm is hard to adopt and requires dedication and discipline.  It is quite foreign to most to first build the proof before building the artifact. The Roman Numerals Kata is meant to be an exercise - a Kata - to reinforce the purpose and value of TDD.
Instructions: Do and Reflect
I do not assign this so that you can prove the solution to me as the solution is easily found.  Rather, I am interested in your reflection on the experience in addition to your results.  That said, here is what I'm asking you to complete:
Do the Roman Numerals Kata in Python: https://codingdojo.org/kata/RomanNumerals/
Create a Github account and create a repository for the work you complete for this Kata
Create a 1 to 2-minute video whereupon you reflect on the experience (assuming you've also kept up with the material in the APP book).
Make a blog post that also reflects on the experience
FAQ:
Do I have to put my video on my blog? No, I understand the privacy implications of this, so you can pass me the URL (or upload) of the video directly.  That said, if you are comfortable in doing so, I am happy to view your video on your blog.
How do I know my tests are sufficient?  This is a question similar to "how do I know my design/architecture is sufficient" and there is no real rubric to answer this, we'll have to practice and self-evaluate along the way.
What I don't know Python/How to Code Well Enough?  Go with what you know - we have to proceed from some point
How do I know I've met your expectations for the video and essay? Reflective Practice is a principle that I value greatly.  You can read a quick description here: https://www.theclassroom.com/reflective-practitioner-8526686.html.  In answer, exercise the mode of the reflective practitioner when I ask for submissions that are reflective in nature.
